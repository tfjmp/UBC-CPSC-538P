<p>This course aims to introduce students to a broad range of topics in Security and Privacy, which inherently intersect with many computer science subdisciplines. Designed as a breadth course, it is open to all students in the department, fostering interdisciplinary engagement and diverse perspectives. The core objective is to facilitate thought-provoking discussions by bringing together varied viewpoints. While this course provides a broad overview, its project component allows students to delve deeply into a specific topic of interest. Students are encouraged to leverage their expertise in machine learning, programming languages, human-computer interaction, computer architecture, or other areas to address specific Security or Privacy challenges. The selected readings emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of Security &amp; Privacy and celebrate the value of diverse approaches and insights.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h2>
<p>There is no specific pre-requisite for this course outside of an undergraduate
degree in Computer Science or closely related topics.
Undergraduate students interested by this course should discuss with their advisor.</p>
<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>reason about security/privacy problems;</li>
<li>learn to read, critique, and write security/privacy papers;</li>
<li>better understand the review process;</li>
<li>learn to work as part of a diverse team on a security/privacy problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-format">Class format</h2>
<p>This is a seminar-type class.
Every class, we will discuss a different paper.
I have selected a mix of recent and older papers.
There will be two presenters during each class.
Each presenter will play a different role: the role of the Advocate and the role of the Critic.
The Advocate should play a role similar to that of the original authors and try to sell the work to the audience.
On the other hand, the Critic while remaining objective should towards the end of the presentation highlight the flaw of the paper and convince the audience that the paper is not good.
The Advocate presentation will last 20-25 minutes, you should motivate the work,
summarize the paper, and present the results.
The Critic presentation will last 10 minutes, you do not need to cover motivation
or summarization, instead you should focus on the shortcomings of the paper.
While shorter, the critical presentation is probably harder to prepare.</p>
<p>In order to do well during your presentation, you should remember to stick to your role (Advocate or Critic).
Further, you do not need to spend too much time explaining the basics of the paper, everyone in the class will have already read it.
What add value to the presentation is your opinion and the insights you can extract from the paper! This is what you should focus on.</p>
<p>You should expect to present at least 2 or 3 times during the term depending on the number of students registered.
After the presentation, we will take a 10 minutes break and discuss the paper.
You should come prepared for those discussions and be ready to engage.
Submissions are to be made on <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/157819/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>, unless specified otherwise.</p>

    <h3 id="research-introduction">Research Introduction</h3>
<p>Your presentation should be approximately 5 minutes long and is designed to help you connect with classmates for the final project. Start by introducing yourself, including your background and current research or areas of interest. Then, either outline a specific project idea you have in mind along with the type of collaborators you are seeking, or describe the types of projects you are interested in joining. The project proposal is due during the first week of February, so forming groups promptly is essential.

<li>Paper reports 30%</li>
<li>Paper presentation(s) 10%</li>
<li>Project (group) 40%</li>
<li>Peer Review 15%</li>
<li>Participation (in-class discussion) 5%</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h1>
<p>You can check the deadlines on <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/157819/assignments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>.</p>
<h1 id="project-suggestions">Project Suggestions</h1>
<p>You should aim for your course project to be roughly the scope of a workshop
paper. It is important to reasonably scope your work as to be able to deliver
before the end of the term. If you embark on a computationally heavy project
(e.g., ML-based malware detection), you need to consider computational cost/time
when planning your project.</p>
<p>You have relative freedom on the topic as long as it relates to security and/or
privacy. You are welcome and encouraged to work on a security topic related to
your own area of research expertise. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USENIX Security</a>, <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACM CCS</a>, <a href="https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IEEE S&amp;P</a> and
<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDSS</a> are considered top security venues. You may find research inspirations
there.</p>
<p>If exploring a new topic seems to daunting a task, you can consider a replication
or comparison study. If you embark on such a task, ensure that you have
access to the relevant software and/or the paper(s) you aim to study are sufficiently
clear for you to reproduce the work.</p>
<p>You should interact with the the teaching team before settling down on a
particular topic.</p>
<h1 id="paper-reports">Paper reports</h1>
<p>For each assigned paper you must write a report. You are to use the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USENIX latex template</a>
for formatting.
You must submit your reports on <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/157819/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>.
In your report, please, follow this structure:</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <h3 id="paper-summary-no-more-than-250-words">Paper Summary (no more than 250 words)</h3>
<p>Provide a brief summary of the paper (3-5 sentences is usually enough). The aim is to demonstrate
that you’ve read (and understood) the paper, so try to paraphrase and extract the essentials. At this
stage you should aim to be objective; later sections allow for your own opinion.</p>
<h3 id="answer-the-following-no-more-than-750-words-in-total">Answer the following (no more than 750 words in total)</h3>
<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>
<p>What is the problem? Why is it important? Why is previous work insufficient (or Why has the
problem not been solved before, e.g. it’s a new problem the authors have identified). This is your take
on what the authors say in the paper (so again should be fairly objective). If the paper doesn’t seem
to tackle a particular problem, then focus on the primary motivation for the work. 1-2 sentences for
each of the three questions is probably sufficient.</p>
<h4 id="the-solution-or-approach">The Solution (or Approach)</h4>
<p>What is their approach/solution? How does it solve the problem? How is the solution unique and/or
innovative (if it is)? What are the details? Once more you should use the paper itself as the source to
help you answer these questions– but, as in previous parts, please do not just copy sections from the
paper. Instead, you should focus on paraphrasing/synopsizing, and extracting the essential details.
Depending on the paper, you’ll probably need 5-10 sentences here.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h4>
<p>How do they evaluate their solution? What questions do they set out to answer? What does the
evaluation say about the strengths and weaknesses of their system? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation itself do you think? A total of 3-4 sentences should suffice here – we’re
looking for highlights, not a point-by-point reproduction of the evaluation section(s).
In the rare case that there is no evaluation section, skip this part of the report.</p>
<h4 id="questions-for-the-authors">Questions for the Authors</h4>
<p>Imagine you’re attending a talk about this paper given by one of the authors. List at least 2 questions
that you would like to ask. These should ideally be specific to the paper/research.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>You should submit 17 paper reports (subject to change)
The 5 worst report score will be ignored (this gives
you 5 effective jokers).</p>
<h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<p>The project must address a non-trivial problem relevant to systems security. The project can resolve the problem by building a system, collecting data/carrying out experiments, developing algorithms and proving them correct, etc. I strongly prefer that you do your project in a team of 2-4 people.
You are encouraged to apply techniques from your main area of expertise to the topic of security (e.g., perform intrusion detection using ML techniques).</p>
<p>You should plan to schedule some time to chat about your project idea with me.
Please, do not hesitate to send me an e-mail as soon as you want to discuss it.</p>
<p>The required project deliverables are listed below.
Written submissions will be made through hotcrp and must be formatted using the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USENIX latex template</a>.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 id="proposal-instuction">Proposal Instuction</h3>
<p>Your proposal should be short (at most 4 pages). The main objective is to
assess the viability of the proposed project. You are expected to have
completed a limited amount of work at this stage.</p>
<p>It must contain the following element:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem statement</strong> (4 paragraphs): <em>Paragraph 1)</em>  At a high level, what is the
problem area you are working on, and why is it important? It is important
to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and
importance to the larger community? <em>Paragraph 2)</em> What is the specific problem
considered in this paper? This paragraph narrows down the topic area of the
paper. In the first paragraph, you have established general context and
importance. Here you describe a specific context and background.
<em>Paragraph 3)</em> What general approach are you planning to take?
Why do you expect significant results? You won&rsquo;t have done the work at this
stage, but you should think about the results you expect to obtain.
<em>Paragraph 4)</em> At a high level, what are the differences between what you are doing
and what others have done?</li>
<li><strong>Related Work</strong> (1 page): There are two types of related work: background work
and contextual work. Background work includes contributions that are required to
understand your work. They must be described in sufficient detail so that any
of your classmates can understand what you are doing and why. Contextual work
is necessary to help the readers place your work and identify your
contributions. This includes past contributions you build upon in your own solution,
work that solves the same problem but in different ways, and contributions from
adjacent areas (solving a similar problem in a different domain). It is important
to remember that doing something differently is not a contribution. It must be
clear why you are taking an alternative approach (e.g., you exercise different trades-off,
improve performance, etc.). You may have yet to perform
an exhaustive literature review when submitting the proposal. Still, you need to have identified important work,
know where to look for more, and clearly understand how your proposal differs
from previous work. If you identify flaws in past work that you aim to address,
identify and state them clearly. If you have yet to read all the papers you intend
to read; you should list all those you have identified and plan to read. You
should also identify areas/domains where you plan to look for relevant
work. However, you should explicitly compare your proposed solution to some
previous work (a few sentences per publication are enough).</li>
<li><strong>Experimental setup</strong> (1 page): What experiments will you conduct? Why? What
question is each experiment designed to answer? What do you hope to learn from
each experiment? What measurement tools will you use? How will you determine if
your measurements are accurate? What tests will you conduct conditionally?
(For example, if we learn X from experiment 1, then we must
do A else do B.) What problems do you expect?
This part is essential to receive meaningful feedback and plan your
research. This is where most of the proposal effort should go.</li>
<li><strong>Resources Needed</strong> (&lt;1 page): What equipment/software/tool will you need?
Do you have access to it? How could you get access? You do not want to find out,
midway through the project, you need access to resources that are not available.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong> (&lt;1 page): You should be as precise as you can, identify important
milestones, and make sure you allocate time to write the report and incorporate
peers feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction from Thesis</strong> (1-2 paragraphs): You can and you are encouraged to work
on a topic related to your thesis. However, your project <strong>must</strong> be
distinct from your main research. You must explicit this distinction (in some
cases, a single sentence is enough).</li>
</ul>
  </div>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <h3 id="proposal-presentation">Proposal Presentation</h3>
<p>The proposal presentation should last no more than 15 minutes. You should expect
questions at the end of the presentation and may allow questions during the
presentation. You should clearly explain what problem you are planning to explore
and why it is an important problem. You should walk your audience through your
research plan and how you are planning to evaluate the outcome of your project.
The presentation should be accessible to a knowledgeable but non-expert audience.
The presentation is graded as a group, how you want to present is the responsibility
of the group members.</p>
<p>Audience should read through the proposal they have been assigned to review
beforehand and be ready to ask some questions. This should be non-adversarial and
with the intent of helping your classmates.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <h3 id="progress-presentation">Progress Presentation</h3>
<p>The progress presentation is a mid-point check to ensure your project is heading
toward the right direction. It will be an opportunity to get feedback from your
peer and the teaching team. You should refer back to your original proposal,
discussing how far along you are and what remains to be done. You should also
discuss any unexpected deviation from your original plan (e.g., things that did
not work as originally planned). The presentation should not last more than 15
minutes, be prepared to answer questions. The presentation is graded as a group,
how you want to present is the responsibility of the group members.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <h3 id="report-instruction">Report Instruction</h3>
<p>You should write your final report as you would write a research paper. Your
report should be at most 8 pages, including figures and tables, but excluding
references. Be sure to highlight your work&rsquo;s limitations honestly
and discuss when your results did not meet your expectations/hypothesis. Try to explain why this happens. I expect some of the reports you submit to
be suitable to be turned into conference submissions. I am more than happy to
work with you to make it happen.
<strong>You MUST include a link to the software artifact(s) backing your paper.</strong>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <h3 id="final-presentation">Final Presentation</h3>
<p>The final presentation should not last more than 20 minutes. You should expect
5/10 minutes of questions at the end of the presentation. You presentation must
discuss the motivation behind your work, the design of your solution, the
evaluation you have performed, and discuss explicitly any limitations of your
work. The presentation should be accessible to a knowledgeable but non-expert audience.
The presentation is graded as a group, how you want to present is the responsibility
